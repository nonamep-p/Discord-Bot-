## üõ°Ô∏è Wick Avoidance Tips

### 1. Bot Behavior
- **Don't respond too frequently** - The bot has built-in delays
- **Use natural language** - Avoid robotic responses
- **Add personality** - Use custom prompts to make it unique
- **Vary responses** - Don't always respond the same way

### 2. Server Settings
- **Role permissions** - Give bot appropriate roles
- **Channel permissions** - Limit bot to specific channels if needed
- **Message history** - Bot needs to read recent messages for context

### 3. Customization
- **Set custom prompt** - Make the bot unique to your server
- **Adjust chat frequency** - Lower frequency = less detection risk
- **Use mention-only mode** - Only respond when mentioned

## üîß Configuration Commands

### Basic Setup
```
!config - Open configuration panel
!prompt set <your prompt> - Set custom personality
!prompt clear - Remove custom prompt
```

```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Wick Kicks the Bot:
1. **Check permissions** - Ensure bot has required permissions
2. **Reduce activity** - Lower chat frequency in !config
3. **Use mention-only** - Set bot to only respond when mentioned
4. **Custom prompt** - Make responses more unique and human-like
5. **Server roles** - Give bot appropriate server roles

### Common Issues:
- **Bot not responding** - Check if it's online and has permissions
- **Permission errors** - Verify bot has required permissions
- **Rate limiting** - Bot has built-in rate limiting to avoid spam

1. **Start conservative** - Use low chat frequency initially
2. **Monitor activity** - Watch how the bot behaves in your server
3. **Customize personality** - Make it fit your server's culture
